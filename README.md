# Fur Elise ChucK sample

This code uses the ChucK programming language to generate music, in this case a simplified version of Beethoven's fur elise (compiled result is here https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzlFeJ0LkmwGcHI3SzdZZUFKamc/view)

ChucK can generate much more sophisticated music, this is a quick and dirty sample I did while researching a language to use with an AI that makes music.
